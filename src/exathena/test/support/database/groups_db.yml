# Player groups configuration file
# ---------------------------------
#
# This file defines "player groups" and their privileges.
#
# Each group has its id and name, lists of available commands and other
# Permissions, and a list of other groups it inherits from.
#
#
# Group settings
# --------------
# <Id>
# Unique group number. The only required field.
#
# <Name>
# Any string. If empty, defaults to "Group <id>". It is used in several @who
# commands.
#
# <Role>
# The name atom, with snake case. It is required and used in "users" table.
# See more in "src/exathena/lib/exathena/accounts/user.ex".
#
# <Level>
# Equivalent of GM level, which was used in revisions before r15572. You can
# set it to any number, but usually it's between 0 (default) and 99. Members of
# groups with lower level can not perform some actions/commands (like @kick) on
# members of groups with higher level. It is what script command getgmlevel()
# returns. Group level can also be used to override trade restrictions
# (db/item_trade.txt).
#
# <Commands>
# A group of settings
# 	<command_name>: <bool>
# or
# 	<command_name>:
# 	  - <bool>
# 	  - <bool>
# First boolean value is for atcommand, second one for charcommand. If set to
# true, group can use command. If only atcommand value is provided, false is
# assumed for charcommand. If a command name is not included, false is assumed for
# both atcommand and charcommand.
# For a full list of available commands, see: doc/atcommands.txt.
# Command names must not be aliases.
#
# <LogCommands>
# Boolean value. If true then all commands used by the group will be logged to
# atcommandlog. If setting is omitted in a group definition, false is assumed.
# Requires 'LogCommands' to be enabled in 'conf/log_athena.conf'.
#
# <Permissions>
# A group of settings
# 	<permission> : <bool>
# If a permission is not included, false is assumed.
# For a full list of available Permissions, see: doc/Permissions.txt
#
# <Inherit>
# A list of group names that given group will inherit commands and Permissions
# from. Group names are case-sensitive.
#
# Inheritance results
# -------------------
# Both multiple inheritance (Group 2 -> Group 1 and Group 3 -> Group 1) and
# recursive inheritance (Group 3 -> Group 2 -> Group 1) are allowed.
#
# Inheritance rules should not create cycles (eg Group 1 inherits from Group 2,
# and Group inherits from Group 1 at the same time). Configuration with cycles is
# considered faulty and can't be processed fully by server.
#
# Command or permission is inherited ONLY if it's not already defined for the
# group.
# If group inherits from multiple groups, and the same command or permission is
# defined for more than one of these groups, it's undefined which one will be
# inherited.
